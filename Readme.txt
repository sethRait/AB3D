One of the main characteristics of VR is the fact that it's completely immersive.  You cannot be distracted by your phone or facebook or other thoughts because it is literally just you and the content. I think that this aspect has great untapped potential for education. I propose we create a simple, elegant education app, specializing in visualizing abstract concepts spatially. EXAMPLE: binary AVL trees- the self-balancing algorithms involve switch around nodes. Imagine it's just you, surrounded by white, and a huge binary search tree. You'll have earbuds in, and can listen to a narration and watch the algorithm in action switching around nodes, so you can visualize the different algorithms. You can also have a small control menu so you can select which rotations to visualize. This could be used to learn other data structures or even other topics as well, just an example. (Main goal with this: make it look nice, easy to use. Like, hardcore simple modern UI.) (Also I want to do well in datastructures this semester, feel that this would help).
